# Python - String Concatenation = به هم پیوستن
# To concatenate, or combine, two strings you can use the + operator.
# Example: Merge variable a with variable b into variable c:

a = "Beautiful"
b = "Afghanistan"
c = a + b
print(c)

a = "Concatenate "
b = "strings"
c = a + b
print(c)

a = "Afghanistan"
b = "Great"
c = "Country"
d = a + " " + b + " " + c
print(d)

a = "World"
b = "Helght"
c = "organization"
d = a + " " + b + " " + c
print(d)
